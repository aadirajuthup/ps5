### What I learned

I learned more than I could with any YouTube tutorial and other resources ever could. Building real projects is the key is so true

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com) - I did almost all the excercises they had which really helped me in understanding everthing about HTML and CSS in a much deeper level.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) - I also did a lot of practice at FreeCodeCamp. Every single student has to check out FreeCodeCamp there is probably no other better resource in the internet than FreeCodeCamp.(for free of cource)
- [CodeWithHarry Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVMnSShP_Iviwkknt83cww) - This whole channel is in Hindi. There is a playlist containing HTML & CSS. He only brushes over the basics you are going to need and I found that useful in identifying what I should focus on first and getting that inital boost to get started as fast as possible.
